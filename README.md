A repository for some of my Raspberry Pi experiment software

1. Arduino interface software.  The sketch_kwoodward_maestro_robotintf.ino is an Arduino IDE file which controls interfacing to the four servos, ir distance sensor, ultrasonic distance sensor, and LCD panel.  It will later be interfaced with the RPi.
